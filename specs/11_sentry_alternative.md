## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (1-2 weeks)

1. **Inventory Current Sentry Usage**

   ```bash
   # Export current Sentry configuration
   sentry-cli projects list
   sentry-cli releases list
   ```

2. **Set Up Google Cloud Monitoring**

   ```bash
   # Enable required APIs
   gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
   gcloud services enable logging.googleapis.com
   gcloud services enable cloudtrace.googleapis.com
   ```

3. **Create Monitoring Workspace**

   ```bash
   # Set up monitoring workspace
   gcloud monitoring workspaces create
   ```

### Phase 2: Implementation (2-4 weeks)

1. **Replace Error Monitoring**

   ```typescript
   // Replace Sentry error reporting
   import { ErrorReporting } from '@google-cloud/error-reporting';

   const errorReporting = new ErrorReporting();

   // Report errors to Cloud Error Reporting
   app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
     errorReporting.report(err);
     next(err);
   });
   ```

2. **Implement Performance Monitoring**

   ```typescript
   // Replace Sentry performance monitoring
   import { Trace } from '@google-cloud/trace-agent';

   // Initialize tracing
   Trace.start();

   // Custom performance metrics
   import { Monitoring } from '@google-cloud/monitoring';

   const monitoring = new Monitoring();
   const metric = monitoring.metric('custom.googleapis.com/app/response_time');

   // Record custom metrics
   await metric.createTimeSeries({
     // metric data
   });
   ```

3. **Set Up Alerting**

   ```json
   // Alert policy for high error rate
   {
     "displayName": "High Error Rate Alert",
     "conditions": [{
       "displayName": "Error Rate > 5%",
       "conditionThreshold": {
         "filter": "resource.type = \"global\" AND metric.type = \"logging.googleapis.com/log_entry_count\"",
         "comparison": "COMPARISON_GT",
         "thresholdValue": 0.05,
         "duration": "300s"
       }
     }],
     "notificationChannels": ["projects/project-id/notificationChannels/email-channel"]
   }
   ```

4. **Migrate Dashboards**

   ```json
   // Custom dashboard configuration
   {
     "displayName": "Application Health Dashboard",
     "gridLayout": {
       "widgets": [{
         "title": "Error Rate",
         "xyChart": {
           "dataSets": [{
             "timeSeriesQuery": {
               "timeSeriesFilter": {
                 "filter": "resource.type=\"global\" AND metric.type=\"logging.googleapis.com/log_entry_count\"",
                 "aggregation": {
                   "alignmentPeriod": "300s",
                   "perSeriesAligner": "ALIGN_RATE"
                 }
               }
             }
           }]
         }
       }]
     }
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (1-2 weeks)

1. **Parallel Monitoring**
   - Run both Sentry and Google Cloud Monitoring simultaneously
   - Compare alert accuracy and timeliness
   - Validate dashboard data consistency

2. **Load Testing**

   ```bash
   # Test monitoring under load
   npm run load-test

   # Verify metrics collection
   gcloud monitoring metrics list
   ```

3. **Alert Validation**
   - Test alert conditions with synthetic errors
   - Verify notification delivery
   - Validate escalation procedures

### Phase 4: Production Migration (1 week)

1. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Migrate one service at a time
   - Monitor for any gaps in observability
   - Update team processes and documentation

2. **Team Training**
   - Train developers on Google Cloud Monitoring interface
   - Update runbooks and incident response procedures
   - Document new alerting and debugging workflows

## Integration with Your SaaS Stack

### Next.js Application Integration

```typescript
// lib/monitoring.ts
import { ErrorReporting } from '@google-cloud/error-reporting';
import { Monitoring } from '@google-cloud/monitoring';

export const errorReporting = new ErrorReporting({
  projectId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT,
  keyFilename: process.env.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS,
});

export const monitoring = new Monitoring({
  projectId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT,
});

// Error boundary integration
export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    errorReporting.report(error, {
      context: errorInfo,
      user: this.props.user,
    });
  }
}
```

### Hono.js API Integration

```typescript
// src/middleware/monitoring.ts
import { errorReporting } from '../lib/monitoring';

export const monitoringMiddleware = async (c, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();

  try {
    await next();
  } catch (error) {
    errorReporting.report(error, {
      context: {
        method: c.req.method,
        path: c.req.path,
        userAgent: c.req.header('User-Agent'),
      },
    });
    throw error;
  }

  // Record response time
  const duration = Date.now() - start;
  // Record metric to Cloud Monitoring
};
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Custom Metrics and SLOs

```typescript
// Define Service Level Objectives
const slo = {
  displayName: 'API Availability SLO',
  goal: 0.99, // 99% availability
  rollingPeriod: '604800s', // 7 days
  serviceLevelIndicator: {
    basicSli: {
      availability: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### 2. Log-Based Alerts

```json
{
  "displayName": "Failed Login Attempts Alert",
  "conditions": [{
    "displayName": "High Failed Login Rate",
    "conditionThreshold": {
      "filter": "resource.type=\"global\" AND metric.type=\"logging.googleapis.com/user/login_failed\"",
      "comparison": "COMPARISON_GT",
      "thresholdValue": 10,
      "duration": "300s"
    }
  }]
}
```

### 3. Anomaly Detection

```json
{
  "displayName": "Response Time Anomaly",
  "conditions": [{
    "displayName": "Unusual Response Time",
    "conditionMonitoringQueryLanguage": {
      "query": "fetch gce_instance | metric 'custom.googleapis.com/app/response_time' | anomaly_detection",
      "duration": "3600s"
    }
  }]
